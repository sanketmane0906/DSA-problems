1) To calculate sum of first n natural numbers

      n(n+1)/2  

     This above formula gives you the sum of first n natural numbers

    for example :-

     if you want to calculate sum of first 10 numbers then

           =10(10+1)/2
           =110/2;
           =5

     The sum of first 10 numbers are 55.
          

2) To calculate number of ways to choose 2 items from n items without regard to the order of selection.
   It is also known as combinations.
   It is denoted as nC2  

       n(n-1)/2;

      for example :-
         no of ways to choose 2 items from 3 items  so n is  n=3  (1,2,3)

            =3*(3-1)/2
            =3*(2)/2
            = 6/2
            =3
 
        there are 3 ways of choosing 2 elelemhst from 3 items
            The ways are (1,2)  (2,3)   (1,3)
