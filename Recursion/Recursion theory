What is recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a functionn calls itself to solve a problem. 
It breaks down complex problems into smaller subproblems of the same type.
This continues until a base condition is met, at which point the recursion stops.


* Key Components of Recursion :-
Base Case: The condition where recursion stops.
Recursive Case: The functionn calls itself with a smaller or simpler input.
