Binary search is also called a half interval search.

In binary search input data must be sorted.

And the most important thing is binaryu search has more efficient time complexity.

Linear search has time complexity O(n) 
Binary search has time complexity O(nlogn)

Binary search has faster than linear search

Binary search code :-

Class Solution
{
    public int binarySearch(int nums[], int target)
    {
       int n=nums.length;
      
      int left=0;
      int right=n-1;
      
      while(left<=right)
      {
          int mid=(left+right)/2;
          
          if(nums[mid]==target)
          {
          return mid;
          }
          else if(nums[mid]>target)
          {
          right=mid-1;
          }
          else
          {
          left=mid+1;
          }
      }
      return -1;
    }
}
