You're given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters and digits. 
Your task is to remove all digits by repeatedly deleting the first digit and the closest non-digit character to its left. 
You need to return the resulting string after performing these deletions.

Example
	Input: s = "cb34"

	Step 1: Delete the first digit ('3') and its closest non-digit character to the left ('b'), resulting in s = "c4"

	Step 2: Delete the next digit ('4') and its closest non-digit character to the left ('c'), resulting in s = ""

Output: ""

so lets code :-

class Solution {
    public String clearDigits(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (!Character.isDigit(s.charAt(i))) {
                sb.append(s.charAt(i));
            } else {
                sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

Explanation of the Code
	Initialization:

		The code initializes a StringBuilder object sb to store the resulting string after removing digits and their adjacent characters.

		Iterating Through the String:

		The for loop iterates through each character in the input string s.

	Checking for Digits:

		Inside the loop, the code checks if the current character s.charAt(i) is not a digit using Character.isDigit(s.charAt(i)).

		If the character is not a digit, it is appended to the StringBuilder sb using sb.append(s.charAt(i)).

	Removing Adjacent Character:

		If the character is a digit, the code deletes the last character added to the StringBuilder sb using sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1). This simulates removing the digit and 		its closest non-digit character to the left.

	Returning the Result:

		After the loop finishes, the code returns the final string by converting the StringBuilder sb to a string using sb.toString().

Edge Cases
	No Digits: If the input string has no digits, the original string remains unchanged.

	All Digits: If the input string consists only of digits, the result will be an empty string.
