In this problem we have given the nums array and we have to retun the maximum difference between two pairs product

mean (a*b)-(c*d)

So here we have the array opf integers

nums = [5,6,2,7,4]

so just observe which two numbers will give you the maximum product so its obevious greater values product if high 
So vice versa the product of smaller number is small

so product of 2 and 4 is 8
and product of 7 and 6 is 42

and difference is 42-8 is 34

So for that we will use in built sorting function so it will optimize time complexity because we dont need to sort the array

so lets code it :-

public class Solution
{
  public int maximumProduct(int[] nums)
  {
          Arrays.sort(nums);
  
          int n=nums.length-1;
  
          int firstPairEle1=nums[0];
          int firstPairEle2=nums[1];
  
          int secondPairEle1=nums[n];
          int secondPairEle2=nums[n-1];
  
          return (secondPairEle1 * secondPairEle2)-(firstPairEle1 * firstPairEle2);
  }
}
