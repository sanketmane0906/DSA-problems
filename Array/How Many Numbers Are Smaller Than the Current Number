In this problem we have to retun the how many numbers are less the current number

Somlets discuss the approac here we will first calculate frequency of the elements of the array
then we will do cummulative sum on the that frequency array

So first lets code :-

class Solution {
    public int[] smallerNumbersThanCurrent(int[] nums) {
        
        int[] bucket= new int[102];

        for(int n: nums)
        {
            bucket[n]++;
        }

        for(int i=1; i<102; i++)
        {
            bucket[i]+=bucket[i-1];
        }

        int result[]= new int[nums.length];

        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++)
        {
            if(nums[i]==0)
            {
                result[i]=0;
            }
            else
            {
                result[i]=bucket[nums[i]-1]; //here -1 taking because less than numbers we want not less than equal to
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

Dry run :-
1) 
for (int n : nums) {
    bucket[n]++;
}

This loop counts the frequency of each number in the nums array.
For example, if nums = [2, 5, 2, 1], then after this loop, bucket will contain:

bucket[1]=1,bucket[2]=2,bucket[5]=1
Other indices remain 0.

2) 
for (int i = 1; i < 102; i++) {
    bucket[i] += bucket[i - 1];
}

This loop updates bucket to store the cumulative frequency of numbers up to index i.
After this loop, bucket[i] represents the total count of numbers less than or equal to i in the original array.
Continuing with our example, the updated bucket would be:

bucket[1]=1,bucket[2]=3,bucket[3]=3,bucket[5]=4
Here:
bucket[1] = 1: There is 1 number ≤ 1.
bucket[2] = 3: There are 3 numbers ≤ 2.
bucket[5] = 4: There are 4 numbers ≤ 5.

3) 
if (nums[i] == 0) {
    result[i] = 0;
} else {
    result[i] = bucket[nums[i] - 1];
}

For each element nums[i], we need the count of numbers strictly smaller than it.
If nums[i] == 0, there are no numbers smaller than 0, so result[i] = 0.
Otherwise, the count of numbers strictly smaller than nums[i] is stored at bucket[nums[i] - 1]. Why?
bucket[nums[i]] contains the total count of numbers less than or equal to nums[i].
Subtracting 1 gives the cumulative count of numbers strictly less than nums[i].

4) Why Subtract -1?
bucket[nums[i]] represents the count of numbers less than or equal to nums[i].
To find the count of numbers strictly less than nums[i], we look at bucket[nums[i] - 1].
