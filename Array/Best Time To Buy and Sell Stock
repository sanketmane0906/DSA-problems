In these example we have the prices array which shows the stock price on that respective day.

So here we have to return maximum profit we can make it from that stock.
So here we can make maximum profit by purchsing that stock on less price and sell it on highest price.

 [7,1,5,3,6,4] so here we will purchase at index 1 mean price is when 1 and sell at index 4 mean when price is 6 so profit will be 5.

So lets code :-

class Solution
{
  public int maxProfit(int[] prices)
  {
  int purchase=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
          int sell=0;
  
          int n=prices.length;
  
          for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
          {
              purchase=Math.min(purchase, prices[i]);
  
              sell=Math.max(sell,prices[i]-purchase);
  
          }
          return sell;
  }
}

Time Complexity will be O(n) where n is size of the array
