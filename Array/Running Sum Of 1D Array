In this problem we have given the nums array and we have to return running sum.

Running sum mean nums[i]= nums[i-1]+nums[i] like that

mean nums[1]= sum of nums[0]+nums[1]

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

So here we have to use just for loop and we will do chages in given array i know it is not goot practice we sould not play with input data.

Java code :-

class Solution
{
  public int[] runningSum(int[] nums)
  {
       int n=nums.length;

        for(int i=1; i<n; i++)
        {
            nums[i]+=nums[i-1];
        }
        return nums;
  }
}
