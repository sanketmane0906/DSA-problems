Here we have nums array which contain integer values and we have to retun missing number from it.

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2

So first we will find the size of array
n=3

now using for loop we will calculate the sum of all elements present in nums

sum=0
for(i=0 to i=n)
{
 sum+=nums[i];
}

Now the third important thing is the formula of sum of first n natural numbers 

sum of N no = (n*(n+1))/2;

this formula will give first n natural numbers 

sum of 3 numnbers is= 3*(3+1)/2
                    =3*(4)/2
                     = 12/2
                    =6

now in the end we will substract sum from the sum of N number
it will give us our result

java code:-

class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        
        int n=nums.length;
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            sum+=nums[i];
        }

        int exceptSum=(n*(n+1))/2;

        return exceptSum-sum;
    }
}
